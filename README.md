# API Specialist Roadmap – 365 Days

> **Goal:** Become an API Specialist with deep understanding of HTTP, REST, API design, security, scalability, and system-level thinking — beyond frameworks.

This repository documents my **365-day API Specialist journey**, focused on **protocol-first learning**, **manual design**, and **real-world backend engineering practices**.

---

## 🎯 Why This Repository Exists

Most developers learn APIs through frameworks.  
This roadmap is different.

The goal is to:
- Understand **HTTP as a protocol**, not just use it
- Design APIs **before** coding them
- Separate **protocol, architecture, and business logic**
- Think like an **API engineer**, not a framework user

---

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

- Foundations first (HTTP → REST → Design)
- Text-first API design before implementation
- Manual request/response thinking
- No framework shortcuts in early phases
- Focus on **why**, not just **how**

---

## 🗺️ High-Level Roadmap

### Phase 1: HTTP & API Foundations (Days 1–60)
- What HTTP really is
- Request & response anatomy
- Headers, methods, status codes
- Statelessness & idempotency
- REST principles (deep, not surface-level)
- Manual API contract design

### Phase 2: API Design & Contracts (Days 61–120)
- Resource modeling
- URI design & versioning
- Error handling strategies
- Pagination, filtering, sorting
- API documentation mindset
- Designing APIs without frameworks

### Phase 3: Security & Reliability (Days 121–180)
- Authentication vs Authorization
- Tokens, headers, API keys
- Rate limiting & throttling
- Idempotency keys
- API failure handling

### Phase 4: Scalability & Architecture (Days 181–270)
- Stateless services
- Load balancers & gateways
- API caching strategies
- Backward compatibility
- Observability & logging

### Phase 5: Implementation & Real Projects (Days 271–365)
- Implementing APIs with Java & Spring Boot
- Filters, interceptors, middleware
- Testing APIs
- Production-ready API patterns
- Interview-level system design discussions

## 📅 Daily Structure

Each day includes:
- **Theory** (core concept)
- **Design thinking** (why it works)
- **Manual examples** (raw HTTP)
- **Practical testing** (Postman / curl)
- **Key takeaways**

---

## ✅ Progress Tracker

- [x] Day 01 – What HTTP Really Is  
- [x] Day 02 – HTTP Request Anatomy  
- [ ] Day 03 – HTTP Response Anatomy  
- [ ] Day 04 – HTTP Methods & Idempotency  
- [ ] Day 05 – HTTP Status Codes (Real Meaning)  


---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Postman (API testing)
- curl (raw HTTP inspection)
- Git (version control)
- Java & Spring Boot (later phases)

---

## 📌 Core Principle

> **Frameworks change. Protocols don’t.**

This roadmap focuses on mastering what does not change.

---

## 🚀 Outcome

By the end of this journey, I aim to:
- Design APIs confidently from scratch
- Explain HTTP & REST at interview-ready depth
- Build scalable, secure backend APIs
- Think like an API architect
